# MTG-Proxy-Generator

This program generates proxies for the card game Magic: the Gathering. These proxies can then be printed off and used.
These copies are meant to test deck ideas before buying the real cards themselves.
Proxies are printed in black and white to save on ink.


I **DO NOT** endorse the use of this program to sell proxies or pass them off as real.
This is meant as a fun programming challenge for me, and to have a decent deck to play against my (much better) friends.


## TODO:
- A GUI
- Support for uncommon card types (planeswalkers, split cards, etc)
- Allow printing of cards through the program
